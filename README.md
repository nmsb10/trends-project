An addictive game both for fans of Marvel characters and those curious about the Marvel universe. Search for the Marvel heros hanging around your part of town, then choose to Fight and eventually capture as many as possible to become the envy of your friends. Look out for bonus health markers to boost your health before the Marvel heros fight back to get revenge. Once you capture a hero, learn the story behind the character and more.
